# GCA003: Implement proper resource disposal

## Rule Description

Classes that implement IDisposable should have their Dispose method called when they are no longer needed. This rule enforces proper resource cleanup by detecting IDisposable objects that aren't properly disposed.

## Rule Details

This rule raises a warning when a local variable of a type that implements IDisposable is not properly disposed before it goes out of scope. Proper disposal can be done using a `using` statement, `using` declaration, or by calling the `Dispose` method explicitly.

### When the Rule is Triggered

The rule checks for:
- Local variables of types that implement IDisposable
- Absence of proper disposal mechanisms

The rule doesn't trigger when:
- The IDisposable object is returned from the method
- The IDisposable object is passed to another method (assuming it will handle disposal)

### Examples of code that violates this rule

```csharp
void ProcessFile(string path)
{
    var fileStream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);
    // Do work with fileStream
    // Missing disposal of fileStream
}
```

### Examples of compliant code

Using declaration (C# 8.0+):
```csharp
void ProcessFile(string path)
{
    using var fileStream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);
    // Do work with fileStream
    // fileStream will be automatically disposed at the end of the scope
}
```

Using statement:
```csharp
void ProcessFile(string path)
{
    using (var fileStream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open))
    {
        // Do work with fileStream
    } // fileStream will be disposed here
}
```

Explicit dispose:
```csharp
void ProcessFile(string path)
{
    var fileStream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);
    try
    {
        // Do work with fileStream
    }
    finally
    {
        fileStream.Dispose();
    }
}
```

## When to Suppress

You might suppress this warning in specific scenarios:

1. When the object is being managed by a different component
2. When using a custom resource management pattern
3. When the disposal is handled externally to the method

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GCA003
var resource = new DisposableResource(); // Disposal handled elsewhere
#pragma warning restore GCA003
```

## Configuration
