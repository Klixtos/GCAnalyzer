# GCA001: Avoid using GC.Collect directly

## Rule Description

Explicit garbage collection through `GC.Collect()` can impact application performance by forcing a garbage collection that might not be necessary. The .NET garbage collector is designed to run automatically at optimal times.

## Rule Details

This rule raises a warning when `GC.Collect()` is called directly in your code.

### Examples of code that violates this rule

```csharp
// Direct call to GC.Collect
GC.Collect();

// Call with parameters
GC.Collect(2);

// Using fully qualified name
System.GC.Collect();
```

### Examples of compliant code

```csharp
// Let the garbage collector run automatically

// If you're experiencing memory pressure, consider:
// 1. Using WeakReference
var weakRef = new WeakReference(myObject);

// 2. Implementing IDisposable properly
using var resource = new MyResource();

// 3. Using memory profiling tools to identify leaks
```

## When to Suppress

You might suppress this warning in very specific scenarios:

1. In unit tests or benchmarks when you need deterministic cleanup
2. In extremely memory-constrained environments where you need precise control
3. In long-running applications with discrete processing phases

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GCA001
GC.Collect(); // Suppressing warning for a specific reason
#pragma warning restore GCA001
```

## Configuration

This rule cannot be configured.
