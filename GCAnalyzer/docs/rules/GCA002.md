# GCA002: Consider using GC.KeepAlive

## Rule Description

In some P/Invoke scenarios, objects might be collected prematurely if they're not referenced elsewhere in the code. This rule checks for cases where `GC.KeepAlive()` should be used to prevent the garbage collector from prematurely collecting objects passed to native code.

## Rule Details

This rule raises an information-level diagnostic when an object parameter is passed to P/Invoke methods or used in unsafe context without a subsequent call to `GC.KeepAlive()`.

### When the Rule is Triggered

The rule looks for:
- Methods with P/Invoke calls (using DllImport attribute)
- Methods calling extern methods
- Reference type parameters passed to these methods
- Lack of a subsequent `GC.KeepAlive()` call on those parameters

### Examples of code that violates this rule

```csharp
[DllImport("native.dll")]
static extern void ProcessBuffer(IntPtr buffer);

void ProcessData(object data)
{
    var handle = GCHandle.Alloc(data, GCHandleType.Pinned);
    try
    {
        ProcessBuffer(handle.AddrOfPinnedObject());
    }
    finally
    {
        handle.Free();
    }
    // Missing GC.KeepAlive(data) here
}
```

### Examples of compliant code

```csharp
[DllImport("native.dll")]
static extern void ProcessBuffer(IntPtr buffer);

void ProcessData(object data)
{
    var handle = GCHandle.Alloc(data, GCHandleType.Pinned);
    try
    {
        ProcessBuffer(handle.AddrOfPinnedObject());
    }
    finally
    {
        handle.Free();
    }
    // Ensure data is not collected prematurely
    GC.KeepAlive(data);
}
```

## When to Suppress

You might suppress this warning in specific scenarios:

1. When you're sure the object will not be garbage collected prematurely
2. When the object is referenced elsewhere in the method
3. When you're handling the object's lifetime in another way

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GCA002
// Code where you're handling object lifetime differently
#pragma warning restore GCA002
```

## Configuration

This rule is not configurable.
