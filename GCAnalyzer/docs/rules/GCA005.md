# GCA005: Use underscore prefix for instance fields

## Rule Description

Instance fields should follow a consistent naming convention. This rule enforces that private instance fields start with an underscore (`_`) followed by a camelCase name. This convention helps distinguish instance fields from other variables and improves code readability.

## Rule Details

This rule raises a warning when an instance field is declared with a name that doesn't follow the `_camelCase` naming pattern.

### What Fields Are Checked

This rule only applies to:
- Private instance fields (fields with `private` modifier or implicitly private)
- Fields in private classes

The rule ignores:
- Static fields
- Const fields
- Readonly fields
- Fields in interfaces
- Fields in enums
- Public/protected/internal fields

### Examples of code that violates this rule

```csharp
public class User
{
    private string name; // Violation: No underscore prefix
    private int userId;  // Violation: No underscore prefix
    private bool IsActive; // Violation: No underscore prefix and PascalCase
    
    public User(string name, int userId)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.userId = userId;
    }
}
```

### Examples of compliant code

```csharp
public class User
{
    private string _name; // Correct: Underscore prefix with camelCase
    private int _userId;  // Correct: Underscore prefix with camelCase
    private bool _isActive; // Correct: Underscore prefix with camelCase
    
    // These don't need underscore prefixes:
    private const int MaxNameLength = 50; // Constants use PascalCase
    private static readonly int DefaultUserId = 0; // Static fields use PascalCase
    
    public User(string name, int userId)
    {
        _name = name;
        _userId = userId;
    }
}
```

## When to Suppress

You might suppress this warning in specific scenarios:

1. When working with legacy code where changing naming conventions would be too disruptive
2. When integrating with third-party libraries that use different naming conventions
3. In generated code

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GCA005
private string name; // Suppressing warning for a specific reason
#pragma warning restore GCA005
```
